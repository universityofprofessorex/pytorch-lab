[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# source: https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/blob/dev/pylintrc
# Reasons disabled:
# locally-disabled - it spams too much
# duplicate-code - unavoidable
# cyclic-import - doesn't test if both import on load
# abstract-class-little-used - prevents from setting right foundation
# abstract-class-not-used - is flaky, should not show up but does
# unused-argument - generic callbacks and setup methods create a lot of warnings
# global-statement - used for the on-demand requirement installation
# redefined-variable-type - this is Python, we're duck typing!
# too-many-* - are not enforced for the sake of readability
# too-few-* - same as too-many-*
# abstract-method - with intro of async there are always methods missing
